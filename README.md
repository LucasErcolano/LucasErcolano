💬 Summary:
Passionate about artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am fascinated by how these technologies are transforming the world, and I dream of being part of that revolution.

I am resourceful, proactive, and I love challenges. That's why I decided to specialize in AI/ML during my university studies. I am looking for an opportunity to apply my knowledge and continue to grow in innovative projects.

Beyond AI, I consider myself a creative person. I like to think outside the box, explore original ideas, and find unique solutions. I also enjoy working in a team, learning from others, and bringing my energy to a diverse group.
